# TaskTracker Enhancements

This document covers the latest major enhancements to TaskTracker.

## Expanded Reporting

### Burndown Charts

TaskTracker now includes a burndown chart generator that helps you visualize project progress over time. This feature is available in multiple formats:

```bash
# Generate ASCII burndown chart in terminal
./lib/burndown-chart.js --format=ascii

# Generate HTML burndown chart with interactive features
./lib/burndown-chart.js --format=html --output=burndown.html

# Generate JSON data for custom visualization
./lib/burndown-chart.js --format=json > burndown.json
```

The burndown chart shows:

- Remaining tasks over time
- Ideal burndown trajectory
- Completion rate (velocity)
- Projected completion date
- Sprint or iteration progress

You can filter by category to focus on specific types of tasks:

```bash
./lib/burndown-chart.js --format=ascii --filter=feature
```

### Completion Rate Metrics and Projections

TaskTracker now calculates and displays:

- Task velocity (tasks completed per day)
- Estimated time to completion
- Projected completion date
- Completion percentage

These metrics are available in all reporting formats and help teams better plan and adjust their workloads.

### Visual Reports with Task Relationships

The HTML reports now show task dependencies and relationships, helping you understand task blocking patterns and critical paths.

## Terminal Compatibility Improvements

### Plain Text Mode

For terminals with limited formatting capabilities or for use in CI/CD pipelines, use the new `--plain` mode:

```bash
tasktracker list --plain
tasktracker view 5 --plain
```

This mode:
- Uses only ASCII characters
- Avoids color codes and special formatting
- Works in any terminal environment
- Is ideal for scripts and automated environments

### Adaptive Layouts

TaskTracker now automatically adapts to different terminal sizes:

- Adjusts column widths based on terminal width
- Optimizes for narrow terminals
- Ensures readability on any screen size

To manually control the layout:

```bash
# Force minimal output for narrow terminals
tasktracker list --minimal

# Use plain text with no formatting
tasktracker list --plain
```

## IDE Integration Improvements

### Enhanced Cursor Integration

The `.cursorrules` file now includes:

- Context switching between tasks
- AI context generation
- PR description generation
- Task-based code comments
- Burndown chart viewing
- Batch command support
- Improved status bar integration

### Task Comment Templates

You can now generate standardized code comments linked to specific tasks:

```javascript
/**
 * Task #42: Implement user authentication
 * Status: in-progress
 * Category: feature
 * 
 * Description:
 * Add secure authentication using JWT
 * 
 * Related Files:
 * src/auth/login.js
 * src/auth/middleware.js
 * 
 * Dependencies:
 * #37, #38
 */
```

### PR Description Generation

Generate professional PR descriptions from task data:

```bash
task.pr_desc 42
```

This generates a formatted markdown description including:
- Task title and description
- Category and priority
- Files changed
- Completed checklist items
- Task dependencies

## Performance Optimization

### Pagination

TaskTracker now supports pagination for large task lists:

```bash
# View first page of tasks (default 20 per page)
tasktracker list

# View specific page
tasktracker list --page=2

# Change page size
tasktracker list --page-size=50

# Navigate through filtered results
tasktracker list --category=feature --page=2
```

This significantly improves performance for projects with hundreds of tasks.

### Indexing for Faster Searches

Task indexing has been improved for faster search and filter operations:

- Category indexes for filtering by task type 
- Status indexes for quick status views
- Priority indexes for sorting by importance
- Relationship indexes for dependency queries

### Caching for Frequently Accessed Data

TaskTracker now caches:

- Task lists for faster repeated access
- Task relationships for dependency visualization
- File associations for quick file-to-task lookups
- Historical data for trend analysis

## Other Improvements

### Multiple Task Selection

You can now perform operations on multiple tasks at once:

```bash
# Update status of multiple tasks
tasktracker update 1,2,3 status in-progress

# Add the same file to multiple tasks
tasktracker update 1,2,3 add-file src/component.js
```

### Enhanced Search Filtering

The filter system now supports:

- Complex boolean logic (AND/OR)
- Filtering by multiple criteria simultaneously
- Regular expression pattern matching
- Full-text search across all task fields

Example:

```bash
# Find all high-priority bugs assigned to a specific person
tasktracker list --category=bugfix --priority=p1-high --custom=assignee="Jane Doe"
```

### Output Redirection

TaskTracker supports output redirection and piping:

```bash
# Save task data as JSON
tasktracker list --json > tasks.json

# Process with other tools
tasktracker list --json | jq '.tasks | map(select(.status == "in-progress"))'
```

This enables more complex automation and integration with other tools.
