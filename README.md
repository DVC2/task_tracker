cd your-project
tasktracker init

# (Optional) Set up automation
tasktracker automate
```

#### Manual Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/tasktracker.git

# Copy the files to your project
cp -r tasktracker/bin/* your-project/bin/

### Upgrading from Previous Versions

If you've previously installed TaskTracker, you can upgrade to the latest version:

#### Upgrading Global Installation

```bash
# Update via npm
npm update -g tasktracker-cli
```

## Usage

### Basic Commands

TaskTracker provides a single unified command that gives you access to all functionality:

```bash
# Create a new task (interactive)
tasktracker add

# Quickly create tasks (non-interactive)
tasktracker quick "Fix login bug" bugfix

# List all tasks
tasktracker list

# Filter tasks (NEW)
tasktracker list --priority=p1-high
tasktracker list --category=feature
tasktracker list --keyword=authentication

# Update a task status
tasktracker update 3 status done

# Add task dependencies (NEW)
tasktracker update 3 depends-on 2
tasktracker update 2 blocks 3

# Add custom fields (NEW)
tasktracker update 5 custom story-points 8

# Track file changes
tasktracker changes

# Take a snapshot of current project state
tasktracker snapshot

# Get help information
tasktracker help
```

### Cost-Optimized Usage

For AI assistant integration with minimal premium tool calls:

```bash
# Run multiple commands in one tool call
./bin/tasktracker-batch commands.txt

# Use stdin for dynamic commands
cat << EOF | ./bin/tasktracker-batch --stdin
quick "Fix login button" bugfix --silent
update 1 status in-progress --silent
list --minimal
EOF

# Use minimal output mode to reduce tokens
tasktracker list --minimal

# Use silent mode for operations that don't need output
tasktracker update 3 status in-progress --silent

# Generate and save task context for reuse
tasktracker view 3 --json > task3_context.json
```

See [Cost Optimization Guide](docs/COST-OPTIMIZATION.md) for more detailed strategies.

## Project Structure

TaskTracker is designed to be minimal but powerful:

- `bin/tasktracker` - Main executable command
- `bin/batch-tasks.sh` - Batch operations script
- `lib/tasktracker.js` - Core task management
- `lib/stats-tracker.js` - Statistics and reporting
- `lib/quick-task.js` - Quick task creation
- `lib/auto-tracker.sh` - Git hooks and automation

## Configuration

TaskTracker creates a `.tasktracker` directory with configuration files:

- `config.json`: Customize project name, versioning type, categories, and statuses
- `tasks.json`: Stores all task data
- `file_hashes.json`: Tracks file changes

- `reports/`: Directory for generated reports

You can edit `config.json` to customize TaskTracker for your project:

```json
{
  "projectName": "YourProject",
  "versioningType": "semver",
  "currentVersion": "0.1.0",
  "taskCategories": ["feature", "bugfix", "refactor", "docs", "test", "chore"],
  "taskStatuses": ["todo", "in-progress", "review", "done"],
  "changelogSections": ["Added", "Changed", "Fixed", "Deprecated", "Removed", "Security"],
  "gitIntegration": true,
  "showChalkWarnings": false
}
```

### Claude Agent Cost Optimization

When using TaskTracker with Claude agents, you can significantly reduce premium tool call costs:

# Instead of multiple separate commands (expensive)
tasktracker list
tasktracker update 1 status in-progress
tasktracker update 2 status done

# Use a single batch command (cost-effective)
task.batch examples/claude-templates/daily-update.txt
```
