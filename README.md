## Quick Start

### Installation

#### Global Installation (Recommended)

```bash
# Install globally via npm
npm install -g tasktracker-cli

# Initialize TaskTracker in your project
cd your-project
tasktracker init

# (Optional) Set up automation
tasktracker automate
```

#### Manual Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/tasktracker.git

# Copy the files to your project
cp -r tasktracker/bin/* your-project/bin/
cp -r tasktracker/lib/* your-project/lib/

# Make the script executable
cd your-project
chmod +x bin/tasktracker

# Initialize TaskTracker
./bin/tasktracker init

# (Optional) Set up automation
./bin/tasktracker automate
```

### Upgrading from Previous Versions

If you've previously installed TaskTracker, you can upgrade to the latest version:

#### Upgrading Global Installation

```bash
# Update via npm
npm update -g tasktracker-cli
```

#### Upgrading Git-Based Installation

```bash
# Pull the latest changes
cd tasktracker
git pull origin main

# Copy the updated files to your project
cp -r bin/* your-project/bin/
cp -r lib/* your-project/lib/
```

Your existing tasks and data will be preserved during the upgrade. Version 1.5.0 adds improved compatibility:
- Works reliably in environments with or without Git
- Fixed formatting issues with chalk 
- More consistent command syntax (e.g., 'add-file' instead of 'addfile')
- Enhanced documentation and help text

### Usage

TaskTracker provides a single unified command that gives you access to all functionality:

```bash
# Create a new task (interactive)
./bin/tasktracker add

# Quickly create tasks (non-interactive)
./bin/tasktracker quick "Fix login bug" bugfix

# List all tasks
./bin/tasktracker list

# Update a task status
./bin/tasktracker update

# Track file changes
./bin/tasktracker changes

# Generate a report
./bin/tasktracker report html

# Take a snapshot of current project state
./bin/tasktracker snapshot

# Compare with previous snapshot
./bin/tasktracker compare 7
```

## Project Structure

TaskTracker is designed to be minimal but powerful:

- `bin/tasktracker` - Main executable command
- `lib/tasktracker.js` - Core task management
- `lib/stats-tracker.js` - Statistics and reporting
- `lib/quick-task.js` - Quick task creation
- `lib/auto-tracker.sh` - Git hooks and automation

## Configuration

TaskTracker creates a `.tasktracker` directory with configuration files:

- `config.json`: Customize project name, versioning type, categories, and statuses
- `tasks.json`: Stores all task data
- `file_hashes.json`: Tracks file changes
- `snapshots.json`: Stores project snapshots for trend analysis
- `stats/`: Directory for detailed statistics snapshots
- `reports/`: Directory for generated reports

You can edit `config.json` to customize TaskTracker for your project:

```json
{
  "projectName": "YourProject",
  "versioningType": "semver",
  "currentVersion": "0.1.0",
  "taskCategories": ["feature", "bugfix", "refactor", "docs", "test", "chore"],
  "taskStatuses": ["todo", "in-progress", "review", "done"],
  "changelogSections": ["Added", "Changed", "Fixed", "Deprecated", "Removed", "Security"],
  "gitIntegration": true
}
```
